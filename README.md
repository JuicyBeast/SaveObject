# SaveObject
<strong>SaveObject</strong> is a save module that will easily allow you to Load/Save then view and change values of your save file at runtime.
Created from a stripped down, cleaned version of <strong>Save Game</strong>, optimized for performance and low footprint.
You can add variables to save exactly the same way you add a variable to a script, no extra coding.<br/> 
<br/> 
<strong>Features:</strong><br/> 
-Saves anything, custom classes included.<br/> 
-Access your saved data through a GameObject.<br/> 
-Setup in 1 script line, 6 steps, 2 minutes.<br/> 
-Load and Save with one line.<br/> 
-Compatible with your file I/O.<br/> 
<br/> 
This is a quick, easy and convenient saving solution for Unity. The solution is lightweight and concise, 
so it may lack extra features and implementation flexibility, but the core is there. I count on you to make
this tool a really powerful asset!
